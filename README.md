CSCI 234 - Software Engineering, Spring 2018

Project00 - Project 0 Version 0

One team member will fork this project repository.

That team member will need to give all other team members access to the forked repository.

All team members will clone the repository on their local machine.

You can import the project to  Intellij or use the terminal command line to edit and execute code.

Each team is to create a new team class using inheritance from the Team Class. 

Each team member is to create a new member class using their name by extending the Member Class. Make sure that the constructor of your new extended class sets your name as the memberName.

Each team member must push to their changes to the team forked repository. 

The team leader (owner of the forked repository) must modify the Team class to instantiate all the team member classes and add them to the member Collection.

Test the code to make sure the Team name and all names of team members prints out upon execution.

I have given an example TeamCool Class and a Member Class. 

Once the code is working, the team leader will issue a pull request to the instructor's repository. The instructor will merge the fork with the base code, and test the resulting code.
